## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a GM viewing monster details, I want to see all six ability score modifiers (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) displayed clearly, so I can quickly reference monster capabilities during gameplay without manual calculation.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I'm viewing an official monster detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a card displaying all 6 ability score modifiers in a grid

2. **Given** I'm viewing a custom monster detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see all 6 ability score modifiers (defaulting to +0 if not set)

3. **Given** I'm viewing encounter table monster details, **When** I open the monster panel, **Then** ability scores are already displayed (existing functionality)

4. **Given** I'm creating/editing a custom monster, **When** I fill the form, **Then** I can input modifiers for each ability score (-5 to +5)

### Edge Cases

- **What if old monsters don't have modifiers?** Default to +0 for all abilities
- **What if invalid modifiers stored?** Clamp to -5 to +5 range
- **Display on mobile?** 3-column grid on mobile, 6-column on desktop

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display all 6 ability score modifiers (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) on monster detail pages

- **FR-005**: System MUST populate all existing official monsters with appropriate modifiers
- **FR-006**: Custom monster forms MUST allow editing all 6 modifiers
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate modifiers are within -5 to +5 range

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-002**: Grid layout MUST be responsive (3 cols mobile, 6 cols desktop)
