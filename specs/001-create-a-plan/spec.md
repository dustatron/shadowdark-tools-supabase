## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Shadowdark Game Master, I need a digital tool to efficiently search for monster statistics, create custom monsters, organize encounter lists, and generate random encounter tables, so that I can spend less time on administrative tasks and more time running engaging game sessions for my players.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a GM preparing for a session, **When** I search for "goblin" monsters, **Then** I see relevant official and community monsters with their challenge levels, stats, and tags, sorted by relevance
2. **Given** I found a monster I want to use, **When** I add it to my "Forest Encounters" list, **Then** the monster is saved to my personal list and I can access it later
3. **Given** I have a list of monsters, **When** I generate an encounter table with a d6, **Then** the system creates a random table with 6 slots populated from my monster list
4. **Given** I want to create a custom monster variant, **When** I copy an official monster and modify its stats, **Then** I can save it as my own custom monster with proper validation
5. **Given** I am a community creator, **When** I mark my custom monster as public, **Then** other users can discover and use it in their games
6. **Given** I am browsing as a guest, **When** I search public monsters, **Then** I can view results and temporarily save up to 3 lists before being prompted to create an account

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a monster with invalid stats (e.g., negative hit points)?
- How does the system handle searches with no results?
- What occurs when a user reaches their guest session limits?
- How are inappropriate public monsters handled through community flagging?
- What happens when a user tries to access another user's private content?
