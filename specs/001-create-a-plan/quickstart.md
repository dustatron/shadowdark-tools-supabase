## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

5. **Mobile layout broken**: Verify Tailwind CSS compilation

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify network requests in dev tools
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Review application logs for server errors
5. Test with different browsers and devices
