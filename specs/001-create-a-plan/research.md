# Research: Shadowdark Monster Manager Technical Decisions

## Technology Stack Research

### Frontend Framework Decision
**Decision**: Next.js 15+ with App Router and React 19
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Next.js App Router conventions
- Server-side rendering for SEO and performance
- App Router provides file-based routing and layouts
- React 19 offers latest performance improvements
- Already established in current codebase

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vite + React SPA: Rejected due to SEO requirements and constitutional mandate
- Remix: Rejected due to existing Next.js infrastructure
- Vue/Nuxt: Rejected due to React expertise and existing components

### Database & Backend Decision
**Decision**: Supabase with PostgreSQL and @supabase/ssr
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Supabase with RLS
- Built-in authentication and real-time features
- PostgreSQL supports complex JSONB structures for monster data
- Row Level Security for multi-tenant data isolation
- @supabase/ssr ensures proper SSR/client hydration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Firebase: Rejected due to constitutional mandate for Supabase
- Traditional PostgreSQL + API: Rejected due to increased complexity
- MongoDB: Rejected due to relational data needs and constitutional requirements

### UI Component Library Decision
**Decision**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement (corrected from Mantine in PRD)
- Accessible components with Radix UI foundation
- Customizable with Tailwind CSS
- Copy-paste components reduce bundle size
- Already integrated in current codebase

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Mantine: Rejected due to constitutional correction to shadcn/ui
- Chakra UI: Rejected due to different design system approach
- Custom components: Rejected due to development time constraints

### Search Technology Decision
**Decision**: PostgreSQL full-text search with pg_trgm extension
**Rationale**:
- Native PostgreSQL search capabilities
- pg_trgm provides configurable fuzzy search levels
- Integrates seamlessly with Supabase
- Sufficient performance for target user scale (500+ users)
- No additional infrastructure required

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Elasticsearch: Rejected due to complexity and infrastructure costs
- Algolia: Rejected due to cost and constitutional simplicity requirement
- Client-side search: Rejected due to scale and performance constraints

### State Management Decision
**Decision**: Zustand for global state, React state for local component state
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and simple compared to Redux
- TypeScript-first design
- Minimal boilerplate code
- Constitutional simplicity requirement
- Good for search filters, user preferences, and cached data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit: Rejected due to complexity for simple use cases
- Context API only: Rejected due to performance concerns with frequent updates
- TanStack Query only: Rejected as complement to, not replacement for, global state

### File Upload Decision
**Decision**: Cloudinary for image storage and optimization
**Rationale**:
- Automatic image optimization and format conversion
- CDN distribution for performance
- Transformation APIs for different sizes (64x64 icons, 300x400 art)
- PRD specification requirement
- Cost-effective for MVP scale

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Supabase Storage: Rejected due to limited image transformation
- AWS S3: Rejected due to additional infrastructure complexity
- Local storage: Rejected due to scalability and backup concerns

### Testing Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for 40% test coverage
- Vitest integrates well with Vite/Next.js ecosystem
- Playwright provides reliable cross-browser E2E testing
- Fast test execution for development workflow
- TypeScript support out of the box

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Jest: Rejected in favor of Vitest for better Vite integration
- Cypress: Rejected in favor of Playwright for better debugging
- Testing Library only: Rejected as insufficient for E2E requirements

### Validation Library Decision
**Decision**: Zod for schema validation
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Zod validation at API boundaries
- TypeScript-first design with type inference
- Runtime validation for user inputs and API responses
- Excellent integration with React Hook Form
- Shadowdark rule validation (XP = CL Ã— 25, stat ranges)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Yup: Rejected due to weaker TypeScript support
- Joi: Rejected due to constitutional mandate for Zod
- Manual validation: Rejected due to maintainability and error-prone nature

### Authentication Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Supabase Auth with email/password and OAuth providers
**Rationale**:
- Built into Supabase platform
- Supports multiple authentication methods
- @supabase/ssr handles SSR authentication properly
- User profile management included
- Admin role management via database flags

**Alternatives Considered**:
- NextAuth.js: Rejected due to Supabase integration preference
- Custom JWT: Rejected due to security complexity
- Third-party auth only: Rejected due to email/password requirement

## Performance Optimization Research

### Database Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
**Rationale**:
- GIN indexes on JSONB fields for monster attributes
- pg_trgm indexes for fuzzy search performance
- Composite indexes for common filter combinations
- Row Level Security policies optimized for performance

### Frontend Performance Strategy
**Decision**: Implement progressive loading and caching
**Rationale**:
- Infinite scrolling for large monster lists
- Image lazy loading with Next.js Image component
- Search debouncing (300ms) to reduce API calls
- localStorage caching for user preferences and guest data

### Deployment Strategy Decision
**Decision**: Vercel deployment with GitHub integration
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement and optimal Next.js hosting
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Edge functions for global performance
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for landing pages
- Built-in analytics and monitoring

## Security Research

### Data Security Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-layered security approach
**Rationale**:
- Supabase RLS for database-level security
- Zod validation preventing malicious inputs
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Content sanitization for user-generated content
- Admin middleware protection for sensitive routes

### Community Moderation Strategy
**Decision**: Proactive and reactive moderation system
**Rationale**:
- Content flagging system for community policing
- Admin dashboard for content review
- Audit logging for moderation actions
- Private-by-default content sharing
- Clear community guidelines and enforcement

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Scaling Strategy
**Decision**: Start with Supabase free tier, monitor and upgrade
**Rationale**:
- Free tier supports initial 500+ user target
- Built-in connection pooling and read replicas
- Automatic backups and point-in-time recovery
- Monitoring and alerting for usage patterns

### Application Scaling Strategy
**Decision**: Stateless application design with edge caching
**Rationale**:
- Next.js stateless design enables horizontal scaling
- Vercel edge functions for global performance
- CDN caching for static assets and images
- Database connection pooling for concurrent users

## Integration Requirements

### External API Integration
**Decision**: Game-icons.net API for icon search, minimal external dependencies
**Rationale**:
- PRD requirement for icon search functionality
- Lightweight integration with caching
- Fallback to local icons if API unavailable
- No critical path dependency

### Licensing Compliance Strategy
**Decision**: Clear attribution and compliance tracking
**Rationale**:
- Shadowdark content licensing requirements
- Source attribution for all content
- User agreement for content sharing
- Admin tools for content management and removal
