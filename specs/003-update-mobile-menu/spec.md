## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a mobile user who is logged into the application**, I want to access all my account features and navigation options from a single menu, so that I can quickly navigate to important sections like the dashboard, profile, and settings without having to open nested menus.

**Current Pain Point**: On mobile devices, authenticated users see their avatar in the mobile menu, but must tap it again to reveal account options (Dashboard, Profile, Settings, Logout). This creates an extra interaction step and poor discoverability.

**Desired Outcome**: When opening the mobile menu while logged in, users immediately see all available navigation options including main pages (Monsters, Spells, etc.) and account-specific options (Dashboard, Profile, Settings, Logout) in a single, flat list.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is logged in and viewing the site on a mobile device (screen width < 768px), **When** they tap the hamburger menu icon, **Then** the mobile menu opens and displays:
   - All main navigation links (Home, Monsters, Spells, Encounter Tables)
   - A visual separator
   - Dashboard link
   - Profile link
   - Settings link
   - Theme toggle option
   - Logout option

2. **Given** a guest user (not logged in) is viewing the site on a mobile device, **When** they tap the hamburger menu icon, **Then** the mobile menu opens and displays:
   - All main navigation links (Home, Monsters, Spells, Encounter Tables)
   - A visual separator
   - Theme toggle option
   - Sign In button

3. **Given** the mobile menu is open, **When** a user taps any navigation link or action button, **Then** the system performs the corresponding action AND automatically closes the mobile menu

4. **Given** a user is logged in as an admin or moderator on mobile, **When** they open the mobile menu, **Then** they see an additional "Admin Dashboard" link in the account section

5. **Given** a user is viewing the site on a desktop device (screen width e 768px), **When** they interact with the navigation, **Then** the desktop navigation behavior remains unchanged (user avatar dropdown menu on the right side)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has a very long display name or email?
  - User initials/avatar should display consistently without breaking layout

- How does the system handle users who don't have a username_slug yet?
  - Profile link should direct to settings page as a fallback

- What happens if the mobile menu content exceeds the viewport height?
  - Menu should be scrollable to access all options

- How does the theme toggle appear in the mobile menu?
  - Should be a clickable option that toggles between light/dark mode

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display all user account options (Dashboard, Profile, Settings, Logout) as direct menu items in the mobile navigation menu when a user is authenticated

- **FR-002**: System MUST include a Dashboard link in the mobile menu for authenticated users

- **FR-003**: System MUST display the theme toggle as a menu option in the mobile navigation (not as a separate icon/button)

- **FR-004**: System MUST show a visual separator between main navigation links and user account options

- **FR-005**: Mobile menu MUST automatically close after a user taps any link or action button

- **FR-006**: System MUST display admin-specific options (Admin Dashboard) in the mobile menu only for users with admin or moderator roles

- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the existing desktop navigation behavior unchanged (user avatar dropdown menu)

- **FR-008**: System MUST show a "Sign In" option in the mobile menu for guest users (not authenticated)

- **FR-009**: Mobile menu MUST be accessible only on viewports smaller than 768px width

- **FR-010**: System MUST handle menu overflow by making the mobile menu scrollable when content exceeds viewport height

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Mobile menu interaction MUST feel responsive with smooth transitions and immediate feedback

- **NFR-002**: User account options MUST be clearly distinguishable from main navigation links through visual hierarchy

- **NFR-003**: Menu items MUST be touch-friendly with adequate tap target sizes (minimum 44x44px)

### Key Entities

- **User Authentication State**: Determines which menu options are displayed (authenticated vs. guest)
  - Properties: logged in status, user role, display name, avatar/initials

- **Navigation Links**: Main application navigation options
  - Properties: label, destination URL, icon (optional)

- **Account Actions**: User-specific menu options
  - Properties: label, action type (navigation or function), icon, permission level
